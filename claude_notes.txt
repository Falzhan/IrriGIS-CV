# Issues in Your Current Training Process

After reviewing your code, I've identified several critical issues that are likely causing your segmentation model to perform poorly:

## 1. Your Dataset Is Using Dummy Masks

In your `CanalDataset` class in data_loader.py, you're creating dummy masks:

```python
# Create a dummy mask tensor of the same size as the image
# This is a placeholder - you would normally load your real masks here
H, W = 224, 224  # Using the same size as the resized image
mask = torch.zeros((H, W), dtype=torch.long)
```

This means your model is being trained on all-zero masks (which would create a model that predicts only background)!

## 2. Class Mismatch

Your model was trained with 12 classes, but you're trying to use it with 11 classes in the inference code.

## 3. No Validation During Training

Your training loop doesn't include validation, which makes it hard to know if the model is actually learning.

## 4. Potential Annotation Format Issues

The way you load annotations doesn't actually appear to use any segmentation masks from the annotation file. It only uses the image paths.

## 5. Potential Training Duration Issue

50 epochs might not be enough for a segmentation task, especially if starting from scratch.
